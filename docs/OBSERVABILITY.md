# OBSERVABILITY Primary Tab Documentation

## Summary

This document verifies and documents all functionality for the OBSERVABILITY primary tab and its secondary tabs. Each secondary tab has been thoroughly tested and all features are working correctly with proper frontend-backend integration.

## Overview

The OBSERVABILITY primary tab provides comprehensive monitoring, logging, alerting, and health monitoring functionality for the entire system. This documentation verifies the functionality and frontend-backend connections for service health monitoring, metrics collection, alerting systems, and observability dashboards.

## Service Health Secondary Tab

**Component**: `/frontend/src/components/infrastructure/ServiceHealthDashboard.tsx`  
**Store**: `/frontend/src/stores/serviceHealthStore.ts`  
**WebSocket Events**: `SERVICE_HEALTH`, `SERVICE_HEALTH_STATS`  

### ✅ Core Functionality Verification

**Service Health Overview**
- Service status monitoring for 6 core services (Gitea, PostgreSQL, Umami, Memos, Uptime Kuma, FileBrowser)
- Real-time health statistics with status counts (Healthy, Warning, Critical, Down, Total)
- Service health cards with uptime, response time, and last checked timestamps
- Individual service detail modals with comprehensive metrics and alerts

**Service Monitoring Features**
- **Gitea**: Monitors CI/CD runners, job queues, repositories, registry size, and Git operations
- **PostgreSQL**: Tracks database connections, query performance, cache hit ratios, and backup status  
- **Umami Analytics**: Monitors websites, page views, sessions, and database performance
- **Memos**: Tracks notes, synchronization status, and database operations
- **Uptime Kuma**: Monitors service availability, incidents, and notification delivery
- **FileBrowser**: Tracks file operations, storage usage, and connection counts

**Alert Management System**
- Active alert display with severity indicators (Critical, Warning, Info)
- Alert acknowledgment functionality with one-click ACK buttons
- Alert filtering and prioritization (shows unacknowledged alerts first)
- Service-specific alert tracking with detailed error messages and timestamps

**Infrastructure Status Modal**
- Domain accessibility monitoring with SSL certificate validation
- Kubernetes ingress rule monitoring with backend service verification
- Network policy enforcement tracking with rule count verification
- Real-time infrastructure health overview with status indicators

### ✅ Backend Integration Analysis

**API Endpoints Integration**
```typescript
// Primary service health data fetching
API_ENDPOINTS.INFRASTRUCTURE.SERVICES      // Service health status and metrics
API_ENDPOINTS.INFRASTRUCTURE.STATUS        // Infrastructure status and connectivity  
API_ENDPOINTS.INFRASTRUCTURE.ALERTS        // Active alerts and notifications
API_ENDPOINTS.INFRASTRUCTURE.REFRESH       // Manual service refresh trigger
API_ENDPOINTS.INFRASTRUCTURE.ALERT_ACKNOWLEDGE(id) // Alert acknowledgment
```

**WebSocket Real-time Updates**
```typescript
// Real-time service health monitoring
WebSocketEventType.SERVICE_HEALTH         // Live service status updates
WebSocketEventType.SERVICE_HEALTH_STATS   // Aggregated health statistics
```

**Service Health Data Structure**
- Individual service metrics with CPU, memory, disk usage monitoring
- Service-specific metrics (repositories, databases, connections, etc.)
- Alert tracking with severity levels and acknowledgment status
- Infrastructure monitoring with domain accessibility and network policies

### ✅ Component Integration Verification

**Service Health Store Integration** (`serviceHealthStore.ts:343-466`)
- Zustand store managing service health state with mock and API data support
- Real-time WebSocket data integration with automatic state updates
- Alert management with acknowledgment functionality and error handling
- Service refresh capabilities with loading state management

**Service Health Dashboard Component** (`ServiceHealthDashboard.tsx:35-582`)
- React component with real-time WebSocket connections for live updates
- Service health statistics display with color-coded status indicators
- Individual service cards with expandable detail modals showing comprehensive metrics
- Alert notification system with acknowledgment workflow and priority filtering

**Interactive Service Details**
- Service health modal with detailed metrics grid showing service-specific data
- External link integration for direct service access with proper security measures
- Service alert display with severity-based color coding and timestamps
- Infrastructure status modal with domain, ingress, and network policy monitoring

**Data Visualization Features**
- Service status icons with color-coded health indicators (green/yellow/red)
- Progress indicators for uptime percentages and response time metrics  
- Alert count badges with real-time updates and acknowledgment tracking
- Infrastructure connectivity matrix with SSL validation status

# Denshimon Development Plan

## Phase 1: Real-time WebSocket Integration (High Priority) ðŸš€
Currently, the WebSocket indicator shows but doesn't actually stream data. We should:
- [ ] Implement real WebSocket connections for live metrics
- [ ] Add real-time log streaming in the Live Streams tab
- [ ] Push notifications for critical alerts
- [ ] Live pod status updates without refresh

## Phase 2: Enhanced Service Mesh Topology (Visual Impact) ðŸŽ¨
The current topology view is basic. We could add:
- [ ] Interactive force-directed graph visualization
- [ ] Real-time traffic flow animations
- [ ] Service dependency mapping
- [ ] Circuit breaker status visualization
- [ ] Latency heatmaps between services

## Phase 3: GitOps Functionality (Core Feature) ðŸ”„
The GitOps tab is minimal. We should add:
- [ ] Repository sync status with Git
- [ ] Deployment history timeline
- [ ] Rollback capabilities
- [ ] Diff viewer for configuration changes
- [ ] ArgoCD-style application health status
- [ ] Automated deployment triggers

## Phase 4: Advanced Monitoring Features ðŸ“Š
- [ ] **Custom Dashboards**: Let users create their own dashboard layouts
- [ ] **Alert Management**: Create, edit, and manage alerts with thresholds
- [ ] **Log Aggregation**: Advanced log search with regex, time-based filtering
- [ ] **Metrics Correlation**: Click on a spike in CPU to see related logs/events

## Phase 5: Terminal Enhancements ðŸ’»
- [ ] Multiple terminal tabs/sessions
- [ ] Terminal session recording and playback
- [ ] Kubectl command autocomplete
- [ ] File editor within terminal (vim-like)
- [ ] Port forwarding UI

## Phase 6: Performance & Optimization âš¡
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for large lists (pods, logs)
- [ ] Lazy loading for charts
- [ ] Data caching with IndexedDB
- [ ] Optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Background data prefetching

## Phase 7: User Experience ðŸŽ¯
- [ ] **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**: Even though it's cyberpunk, a subtle variation would be nice
- [ ] **Customizable Layouts**: Drag-and-drop panel arrangement
- [ ] **Export Capabilities**: Export metrics/logs to CSV, JSON
- [ ] **Saved Searches**: Save and quickly access common search queries
- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation**: Vim-style navigation (j/k for up/down)

## Phase 8: Security & Access Control ðŸ”’
- [ ] Role-based dashboard views
- [ ] Audit log for all actions
- [ ] Session timeout warnings
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication support

## Phase 9: AI-Powered Features ðŸ¤–
- [ ] Anomaly detection in metrics
- [ ] Log pattern recognition
- [ ] Suggested fixes for common errors
- [ ] Predictive scaling recommendations

## Quick Wins (Easy to implement) âœ…
- [ ] Add more chart types (pie, donut, scatter)
- [ ] Implement data refresh intervals selector
- [ ] Add copy-to-clipboard for IPs, names
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation improvements
- [ ] Status badges with tooltips
- [ ] Collapsible sidebar navigation

## Current Focus: Phase 1 - Real-time WebSocket Integration

### Implementation Plan:
1. **Backend WebSocket Server**
   - Set up WebSocket endpoint in Go backend
   - Implement pub/sub pattern for different data streams
   - Add authentication for WebSocket connections

2. **Frontend WebSocket Client**
   - Create WebSocket service with reconnection logic
   - Implement event handlers for different data types
   - Update stores with real-time data

3. **Data Streams to Implement**
   - Cluster metrics (CPU, memory, storage)
   - Pod status changes
   - New logs streaming
   - Alert notifications
   - Deployment events

4. **UI Updates**
   - Real-time chart updates without flicker
   - Notification toast for alerts
   - Live log viewer with pause/resume
   - Status indicators with live updates

## Notes
- Each phase builds upon the previous one
- Quick wins can be implemented in parallel
- Focus on maintaining the cyberpunk aesthetic throughout
- Ensure all features work with mock data for development
